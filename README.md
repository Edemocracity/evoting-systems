evoting-systems
===============

Archive of existing evoting systems created by others.

Several commercial and academic e-voting systems have been published
or are in use in binding elections and yet the companies/authors have
notyet, or will not, release the source code to the community.  We
have made formal requests for the source code of all of these systems,
all of which have been denied or deferred.  Some of the authors of
these systems are promising to release a snapshot of their system in
the future.

These systems include:
* iVote: http://ivote.nsw.gov.au/
* Wombat: http://www.wombat-voting.com/
* UNivote: https://www.univote.ch/voting-client/
* Humboldt County Election Transparency Project (ETP)

* The Open Source Digital Voting Foundation (OSDV)
