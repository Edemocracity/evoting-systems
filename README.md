===============

Archive of existing evoting systems created by others.

Several commercial and academic e-voting systems have been published
or are in use in binding elections and yet the companies/authors have
not, or will not, release the source code to the community.  We have
made formal requests for the source code of all of these systems, all
of which have been denied.

These systems include:
* iVote: http://ivote.nsw.gov.au/
* Wombat: http://www.wombat-voting.com/
* UNivote: https://www.univote.ch/voting-client/
* Humboldt County Election Transparency Project (ETP)
