9.	General

a.	This Agreement will be governed by laws of the state of Washington, 
U.S.A., and controlling U.S. federal law. The federal and state courts 
located in King County, Washington shall be the exclusive venue for 
resolution of any dispute under this Agreement. The Licensee 
consents to the jurisdiction of the Washington courts set out above 
and to any form of service (including by fax and/or email).  The U.N. 
Convention for the International Sale of Goods and the choice of law 
rules of any jurisdiction will not apply. 
b.	English is the governing language of this Agreement and all 
communications hereunder.  This Agreement may be translated into 
another language for the convenience of a party, however, in the 
event of any conflict, the English language version shall control.  
c.	The failure of either party to insist upon strict performance of any of 
the terms and conditions in this Agreement, or to exercise any rights 
or remedies, shall not be construed as a waiver of its rights to assert 
any of the same or to rely on any such terms and conditions at any 
time thereafter.  
d.	The invalidity in whole or in part of any term or condition of this 
Agreement shall not affect the validity of other parts hereof.
e.	Software, Documentation and technical data delivered under this 
Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be 
subject to export or import regulations in other countries.  Licensee 
agrees to comply strictly with all such laws and regulations. Licensee 
agrees to cooperate fully with any official or unofficial audit or 
inspection that relates to export controls.   The Software includes 
cryptographic and encryption capabilities that are subject to U.S. 
export controls.  Accordingly, you may not download the Software if 
you are located in any country (or are a national of a country) subject 
to a general U.S. or U.N. embargo or are deemed to be a terrorist 
country (i.e., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) 
by the United States (each a "Prohibited Country") or are otherwise 
denied export privileges from the United States or Canada ("Denied 
Person").  Further, you may not transfer or re-export the Software to 
any such country or Denied Person without a license or authorization 
from the U.S. government.  By downloading the Software, you 
represent and warrant that you are not a Denied Person, are not 
located in or a national of a Prohibited Country, and will not export 
or re-export to any Prohibited Country or Denied Party.
f.	It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision 
of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of the provisions of Section 3 
of this Agreement or breach or infringement of the Intellectual 
Property Rights and other rights under this Agreement will cause 
VoteHere irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages 
would be inadequate, and that VoteHere will therefore be entitled to 
seek timely injunctive relief to protect VoteHere's rights under this 
Agreement in addition to any and all remedies available at law.
g.	Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or 
obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent 
of VoteHere, which may be withheld in VoteHere's sole discretion. 
VoteHere may assign this Agreement. 
h.	Any tax, levy, or other governmental charge, which may be assessed 
against any party, and which is related to this Licensee's possession 
or use of the Software, will be paid by Licensee.
i.	This Agreement is the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject 
matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written 
communications, proposals, conditions between the parties relating to 
its subject matter.  No modification to this Agreement will be binding, 
unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each 
party.
j.	No Third Party Beneficiaries.  This Agreement is solely for the 
benefit of the parties hereto, and nothing in this Agreement will be 
deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or 
entity not a party to this Agreement.

THE SOFTWARE AND ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION ARE
