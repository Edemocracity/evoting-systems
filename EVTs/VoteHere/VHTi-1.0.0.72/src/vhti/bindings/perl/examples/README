To run all these, do `./womb-to-tomb.sh'.

Note that many of these programs output a lot of XML data; often they
dump out the same data in a few slightly-different forms (i.e.,
they'll dump out both key generation parameters *and* crypto group
parameters, even though the latter is entirely contained within the
former).  This is for the benefit of the XML validation tests, which
use those files as test data.
