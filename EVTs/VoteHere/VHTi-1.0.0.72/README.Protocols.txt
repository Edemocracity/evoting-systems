VHTi PROTOCOLS


VHTi PROTOCOLS 
The cryptographic principles used in VHTi are outlined in two papers called Detecting Malicious Poll Site Voting Clients and Verifiable Mixing (Shuffling) of ElGamal Pairs, both by Dr. C. Andrew Neff. These papers were release in September 2003 and can be found at http://www.votehere.com/documents.html. Along with the papers, a VHTi threat analysis, comprehensive matrix of potential attacks and countermeasures, was also released. The protocols are the key to a full understanding of VoteHere’s technology.  


VHTi API
VoteHere has packaged a reference implementation of the protocols in an application programming interface (API) and is now releasing a reference implementation of the API source code for public review and evaluation. The VHTi API is not a voting system. It makes electronic voting systems trustworthy by adding end-to-end verification and audit capabilities. The VHTi protocols and reference implementation API are not freeware, shareware, or open source. They are proprietary and protected under patent, trademark, and copyright law.
